# A* Search Algorithm Unity Game

This project demonstrates the implementation of the A* (A Star) Search Algorithm within a Unity game environment. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, widely used in games and AI applications for finding the shortest path between points.

## Features

- **Interactive Unity Game**: Visual demonstration of A* pathfinding in a grid-based environment.
- **Customizable Grid**: Easily change grid size, obstacles, start and end positions.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the algorithm progress as it searches for the shortest path.
- **Performance Insights**: See how changes in heuristic or obstacle layout affect the algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (version 2020.3 LTS or newer is recommended)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielzolmajdi/A_Star-Search-Algorithm-UnityGame.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Unity**:
   - Launch Unity Hub.
   - Click on "Add" and select the cloned project folder.

3. **Build & Run**:
   - Open the main scene (usually `/Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`).
   - Click the Play button to start the demonstration.

## How It Works

- The grid is generated in Unity, and you can place obstacles to create a map.
- Select start and end points.
- The A* algorithm will search for the shortest path, visualized step-by-step.
- The path found (if any) will be displayed distinctly.

## Customization

- **Grid Size**: Modify grid parameters in the Unity Inspector or via script.
- **Obstacles**: Add or remove obstacles during runtime or in the editor.
- **Heuristics**: Change the heuristic function to experiment with different behaviors (e.g., Manhattan, Euclidean).
